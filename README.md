- ## About Me ##
  
   
   Hello everyone, I am Chandra Mouli from S1 (CSE Core). I am one of your first-year members.
   Myself, I am from Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh. I am totally new to coding and programming, but I still have full confidence that I'll overcome it as soon as possible. 
   I am very much interested in doing research in AI and also interested in playing instruments and so on.

  
    
- ## Why should we choose you? ##

   You should choose me because I am a person who is very much interested in doing research on my new ideas in any projects, even during my school days.
   For example, I presented a mini walking robot, a flying drone with motors, and also demonstrated the motor in detail, etc.
   These achievements reflect my "patience level," "deep understanding," "dedication towards research," and my "hard and smart work."
   Not only that, I got a silver medal in karate in my school and won many prizes in running, kabaddi, etc.

   I also know how to play the rhythm pad, and I really enjoy playing it.
   

- ## How do you intend to contribute back to the club? ##
  
   I will give my full potential and attention towards this club and also gradually improve my skills.


- ## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them? ##

   Actually, my field of interest is in AI.
   I have many ideas and thoughts in my mind to implement, and I am planning to use my free hours in the morning and evening to improve my skills every day.
   I also want to excel in extracurricular activities too. I am confident that I will reach my goals and targets.
