- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mouli7666

-  You should choose me, Why because I'am the person who has very much intersted in doing research on my new ideas in any projects, even in schoolhood.
   As an example I presented a mini walking robot, a flying drone with the motors and also demonstrated the motor in deep, etc.. 
   These tells about my "patience level", "deep understanding level", "dedication towards research", and my "hard and smart working".
   Not only that, I got a silver medal in karate in my school, and many prizes in running ,kabadi etc. 
   I also know how to play Reathem pad and I really enjoy to play that.
   

-  I'll give my full potential and attention towards this club. And also improve my skills gradually.


-  Now, my field of interest is in AI.
   I have meny ideas and thoughts in my brain to implement those, I'am planning to take free hours at the morning and at the evening to improve my skills every day.
   And I also want to do great in extra curriculum activites too. Definitely I'll prepar a schedule soon as possible.
