# RuskOS

A kernel is the core program around which an operating system is built. Utilising a custom inhouse kernel can mitigate potential telemetry and spyware built into an operating system such as Windows.

Tanya Von Degourachaff was delivering a package on behalf of Doktor Wilhelm Voigt that contained such a kernel. It was a little program called the Kreschnder cipher, A kernel written in Rust that contained a unique text pattern required to activate their new state-of-the-art aerial defence system.

Unfortunately, the kernel sustained some damage due to an enemy ambush on the way to the destination. Now it’s up to you, a field engineer Dingus to restore the kernel before shipping it back out.

## Objectives:

- Resolve the syntax errors
- Change the background color to black and text color to yellow
- Correct the keyboard port address to correct port address for the x86 architecture
- Correct the inverted text input

## Expected output:

## Requirements:

- Rust nightly
- Qemu

## Some pointers:

- The source code is located at the src/ directory
- The bulk of the incorrect code is primarily located at the following files:
  - main.rs
  - interrupts.rs
  - vga_buffer.rs
- The passcode is "amfoss"

## How to Start:

This guide will walk you through the setup process of the RuskOS kernel. Follow the steps below to install Rust (nightly), QEMU, and other necessary tools.

#### Step 1: Install Rust and Rustup

First, we need to install Rust and Rustup, the toolchain installer for Rust.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install Rust and Rustup by running the following command:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

#### Step 2: Install Rust Nightly

1. RuskOS requires the nightly version of Rust. Install it with the following commands:

   ```sh
   rustup toolchain install nightly
   ```

2. Set the default toolchain to nightly:

   ```sh
   rustup default nightly
   ```

#### Step 3: Install QEMU

1. QEMU is needed to emulate the hardware for running the RuskOS kernel.

- Update your package list:

  - On Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    ```
  - On Fedora:
    ```sh
    sudo dnf update
    ```
  - Install QEMU and related packages:

    - Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install qemu-system
    ```

  - Fedora:
    ```sh
    sudo dnf install @virtualization
    ```
    - MacOs:
      1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
         ```sh
         /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
         ```
      2. Install QEMU:
         ```sh
         brew install qemu
         ```

#### Step 4: Running the app

1. Clone the RuskOS Repository
   Clone the RuskOS repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
       git clone https://github.com/BiscuitBobby/ruskos-problem-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
       cd ruskos-problem-repo
   ```
3. Install Bootimage:

   Bootimage is a tool that creates bootable disk images from your Rust kernel.

- Install Bootimage by running:
  ```sh
  cargo install bootimage
  ```

4. Add LLVM Tools Preview Component:

   LLVM tools are required for building the kernel.

- Add the LLVM tools component:
  ```sh
  rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
  ```

5. Build and Run the Kernel

- Build the kernel:
  ```sh
  cargo clean
  cargo build
  ```

6. Run the kernel using QEMU:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
