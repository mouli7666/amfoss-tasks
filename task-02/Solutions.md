# Part 1 #
I opened this link (https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos) after that i went into the codes and copied that code . After that I went into terminal and used the command 'git clone' and downloded Terminal-Chaos.
After that I went into Terminal-Chaos and going into Arrakis-dex followed by Eolian Caves and i searched for parchment in different enterences.
And in some eanterence I got the parchment .And thats how I completed part 1

# Part 2 #
First I Use grep to find the filenames of herbs which have both “holy" and "good” inside their content. And by following the given instructions I got the holy spell . After getting that I serched for Kharnok the Bloodforged in The-Light-Realm and I killed the Kharnok by using the holy spell.And I unlocked to some new branches.I also serched for Celestial Veil Amulet I got that code for this. And I went to search for the lightbook and I got the code .


# Part 3 #
I came into the Dark Realm-I , and I am searching for the chests . Here in the the Dark Realm-1 I found out the chest 1 in that I got DarkBook-1 and I totally searched this realm and I found nothing for that I went into the Dark Realm-II here also I did the same thing and in the process I found chest2 in that I got DarkBook-2 . And thats how I completed the part 3.


# Part 4 #
In the part 4 , they asked me to decode the sum of all the four important codes . And I learnd that to decode that we want to use ("clone '_____________'  | base64 -d" ) this command for decoding that and I got a link to . Thats how I solved part 4.


# Part 5 #
In this part,I came into GodSuite branch and I read all the open book scripture.txt files and I got the secret code what I want and I decode that code using ("clone '_____________'  | base64 -d"). And I opened the link ,It opens to another github repository and they instructed me to clone the repository and I did it and I run the victoy.py file and I recived the winning token.Thats how I did part 5

# Experience #
As I mentioned above that  ## " I searched for that and I got it " ## .This is not as much easier as I told . While I am doing this parts, some times Literally I got Headache, And some times My brain was freezed and dont know what to do.
But still I learn so many things about git  and github and how they related and also what are the commands of git and what are the commands of terminal and many things..
